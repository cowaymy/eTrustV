        <p>Dear All,</p>
        <br>

        <p>
            Effective January 2, 2025, all IT service requests will be managed exclusively through the new TrustDesk system.
            Please take note of the following key dates and actions required:
        </p>
        <br>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Immediately:</strong> Ensure that all open tickets in the current TrustDesk system are closed.</li>
            <li><strong>January 2, 2025:</strong> The current TrustDesk system will no longer accept new ticket submissions.</li>
            <li><strong>January 11, 2025:</strong> Access to the current TrustDesk system will be permanently disabled.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <br><br>
            If there are any tickets that cannot be closed by January 11, we kindly ask you to re-register them in the new TrustDesk system.
            We will do our best to support you promptly.
            <br><br>
